# Whiteboarding
Reshape a project & learn in the process

### What
- Create project specific folders
- Start with projects that are used across e.g. containerd, runc, etc
- Try these projects based on your innovations
- Trying is an exercise to dive deep into the internals of the project

### How
- Verify public APIs/SDKs using Golang's example_test.go
- &/ Verify usage using https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go

### I will spend my time here & put forth my thoughts:
